# lojax

This is a JavaScript library I've been slowly tweaking for a few years. 
It enables flexible communication between client and server via a declarative syntax and a JavaScript API. 
This version has been completely refactored and has been extended to include JSON modeling and binding features.

lojax was designed for server-rendered web applications. It makes possible a single-page architecture where
the main layout, scripts, stylesheets and other resources are loaded once at the beginning. Thereafter they are never
requested again, and the application communicates with the server entirely via AJAX, resulting in a cleaner, more fluid
and faster application.
