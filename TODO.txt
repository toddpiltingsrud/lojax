Better error handling. Currently if a request fails, afterRequest doesn't fire, leaving everybody hanging.

Compound data-form selectors will fail if one of them is selecting a form parent and the other is selecting a specific set of elements.

Turn modal creation into a service that controls the lifetime of modals. 
It needs to be able to import modals and keep their content around if necessary.
Perhaps we'd be looking at using a custom element:

<jax-modal id='modal1' src='http://...' prefetch='true/false' destroy-on-close='true/false'></jax-modal>

So the modal could be opened multiple times, and optionally downloaded from the server every time.

Do we need a different content type for JSONP?

Create a nuget package.
